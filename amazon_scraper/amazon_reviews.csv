B09G9FPHY6,"From the moment I unboxed the Apple iPad 9th Generation, I knew it was something special. The sleek design and the brilliant 10.2-inch Retina display immediately caught my eye, promising a world of vibrant colors and sharp visuals that didn't disappoint.Performance-wise, the A13 Bionic chip with Neural Engine is a powerhouse. It handles multitasking with ease, whether I'm editing 4K videos, playing graphics-intensive games, or jumping between dozens of tabs on Safari. The efficiency and speed are simply unmatched at this price point.What truly sets the iPad 9th Gen apart is its user-friendly interface. iPadOS is intuitive, making it accessible for both tech-savvy individuals and those who might not be as familiar with modern gadgets. The added support for the 1st generation Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard expands its functionality, seamlessly transitioning the device from a consumption powerhouse to a creative and productivity workhorse.Battery life is another area where the iPad shines. Even with heavy use, I consistently get through a full day without reaching for the charger. It's reassuring to know I can rely on my device throughout the day, whether I'm working remotely or lounging at home.The front and back cameras are more than adequate for video calls and general photography. The Center Stage feature on the front camera is particularly impressive, keeping me in view even as I move around during video calls.Accessibility features also deserve a mention. With VoiceOver, AssistiveTouch, and other built-in tools, Apple continues to ensure that their devices can be used by everyone, which is commendable.In conclusion, the Apple iPad 9th Generation is a triumph of technology.

B09G9FPHY6,"Best value overall in the Apple iPad lineup.  You can pay more but for the average user, this model has the most bang for the buck.  Super easy set up and integration with other Apple products.  Only thing that could be better is the battery life.  Under steady use, it does not last quite as long as advertised.  On the positive side, it recharges faster from the ""low battery"" warning level than my my iPhone or my Macbook Pro ever have.","Excellent features, does everything needed and more.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2024",TRUE,5
B09G9FPHY6,"I'm the kind of person who prefers to have newer versions of products, but decided to give this one as a gift to someone who has never used an Apple product. This model was affordable and only a couple of years old, so I thought it would still fair pretty well for what this person wanted to use it for. Let me just say, this product blew my expectations right out of the water. It works extremely well! It's not slow, laggy, or constantly freezing/crashing. It works well with the first-generation Apple Pencil, connects easily via Bluetooth, and has great touch-screen sensation. It easily runs the Procreate and Canva apps and is able to keep other apps in the background without issue. I am very pleasantly surprised about this, as I was expecting a cheap, old product.

B09G9FPHY6,"As my review title says - If you just want a basic iPad for a great price, this is it - while it lasts! Although the 9th gen iPad has an older design with a larger bezel and TouchID home button, it still works great as a basic tablet to do simple things. The most common activities - browsing the internet, checking email, chatting through Facetime, reading news, and playing basic arcade games - do not require you to have the latest, greatest, and more expensive iPads when this one can do it all without compromise or a reduction in experience.The fact that the current pricing is $80 under MSRP makes it a steal; at this price, I don't see why one would buy some inferior tablet from other brands when a genuine Apple iPad can be had for under $250! But of course, this price can only last so long, so if you want a basic but high-quality, fully functioning tablet, you can't go wrong here.","If you just want a basic iPad for a great price, this is it","Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2024",TRUE,4

Like the first one it is functioning and wonderful!  Their customer service was great.  They asked only that I send them a video but I can’t find the case so I suspect in my disappointment I tossed it.  I just wanted to post this because their customer service was great.UPDATED May 8, 2023: I have been using this case and still say I love the concept HOWEVER,  after using it for awhile the small pieces at the bottom that hold the iPad in place no longer do so.  With use it does begin to turn easier to flip and use for writing… but, eh the iPad starts to pop out then too so you still have to go slow.  I would not buy this particular one again nor would I recommend it until they come up with a better idea to keep the iPad securely in place.I received this yesterday.  To connect to blue tooth you have to press the fn + C button.  I looked at the top for the fn key.  It is bottom left.  The case seems sturdy.  A little hard to turn the iPad case so you can view it from different angles or fold it ( you have to turn the top all the way around until iPad is facing away from  you then lay it down to use it as a tablet).  It feels sturdy,  the keyboard is great and you have options for backlight color but I honestly don’t care about the color.  I love that the pencil sits in the case instead of the table where my grand daughter found it.  The only issue I have is that the iPad and pencil always start to slide out when I try to open it.  It does disconnect from blue tooth.  IF you stop using it for a few minutes but if you click on a key it reconnects quickly.  I LOVE that I can get to the volume buttons from the keyboard again.  As I type this the cursor does sometimes move but I believe that’s because I hit the trackpad.  When not in use you can easily turn the trackpad off by pressing fn +t while you type and press it again to turn the trackpad back on.

B0CN312XV4,So I actually bought the completely wrong size of this one like an idiot but I loved it so much after testing it out with my friends iPad that I purchased the one that fit my iPad as well (10.9in). This protects my iPad well and I love the keyboard functionality. So many people have complimented me on the item and initially think that it’s a laptop. It also has a convenient holding spot for my apple pen so it’s got everything I need. The battery seems to hold well and I am happy that it has an auto sleep button in case I forget to shut it off. Very pleased with the durability and the weight it gives to my iPad.,I bought the wrong one…,"Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2024",TRUE,5
B0CN312XV4,"So, I received this iPad Pro case today and I like it already!  The keys are nice and stiff and very responsive.  There’s a nice “nook” at the top to store the Apple Pencil.I’ve tried the Apple iPad Pro case and -hated- it.  It didn’t allow me to recline the screen very much and my fingers kept bumping into the bottom of the iPad Pro.  I did like that it was magnetic and snapped right in, but is definitely my -least- favorite case.  I also tried the Logitech case, which is not bad but Logitech changed the design from the previous model which had a magnetic “strap” to keep the pencil in place.I will likely update this in a few weeks since I haven’t had a lot of time with yet yet.  Some other reviews mention durability,.  I’m pretty careful with my electronics and don’t manhandle them, so, I’m hoping this case holds up well.  This is definitely worth trying out and won’t break the bank.",Best iPad Pro case so far!,"Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2023",TRUE,5
B0CN312XV4,"Love love love this case. It's turned my iPad into a Mac with ease. Love the light up keypad and I love that the holder can rotate - took me a while to figure out and I almost thought it was falsely advertised but nope, it works perfectly fine.Highly recommend.",Love it!,"Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2024",TRUE,5
B0CN312XV4,"I use the product for work. I have had for 7 months. So takes quite a bit of abuse and has held up.  This positive being said they must improve the screen tab holders at the bottom.  Over time they do not hold the iPad in place.  They do not go over the screen far enough to prevent the screen from popping out every time you open the iPad from the keyboard.  This only happened after use and is a weak point of the design.  Please change for future revisions.  Why?  I have tried several and this one by far out performs the others on the Amazon site.  The keyboard lasts a long time, couple weeks, without a charge.  I use every day throughout the day.  It connects to the iPad quickly compared with other types.  It is not as seamless as the apple cover, but it is secondary market.  The reason I changed from apple is this unit lays flat when I want to write notes, etc.  apple does not very cumbersome to use as a tablet.  This unit compared with others has a good holder for the apple pen.  Other units use the magnet solely and I have lost and wrecked 2. This unit I have not lost a pen to date.",Very Good iPad cover and keyboard,"Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2023",TRUE,4
B0CN312XV4,"At first it worked great! For about 1.5 weeks! Now, the spacebar doesn’t work half the time. The arrow buttons have never worked when you’re typing (in Google search, for ex.) and you want to “arrow” down because it finished your search text for you. The balance is not good, either. Your iPad will be TOO heavy for this (12.9 pro)—you’ll have to have this open at about 90° - anything past is sketchy! The color is nice, but doesn’t make up for what’s negative about it.I wish I’d kept the original packaging.I cannot recommend this product, at all.",DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY!

B0CN312XV4,"My IPad Pro is my main computer.  This keyboard did not work well with the Notability app which I use a lot for file saving and drawing.  Had a lot of glitches or none responsive key strokes and kept kicking me off the app or closing a file whenever I was doing simple typing or cutting and pasting text from other sources.  There were also some none-responding when on Amazon. Connectivity was easy but I didn’t like how it shut itself off so often when not in use even though I understand it was used to save power.  If you’ve never used a track pad, it might take a while to get used to it or was it just being unresponsive?  I decided not to use it anymore after using for about a week.",Not great.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2023",TRUE,3
B0CN312XV4,"I am really enjoying using this keyboard with my iPad Pro.  I like the flexibility it given me in using the iPad more like a laptop when desired (lots of typing).  I find the touch pad very helpful and like the feel of the keyboard.  The key backlighting works well in low light situations.  I also wanted to say how impressed I was with the customer service when I started to have an issue with some of the keys.  I was using the original one I received for about 4 months when I started having trouble with a few of the keys typing more than 1 letter (actually it was the t key always typing t5 for some reason).  The Amazon return window was 1 month.  I contacted the company directly as they advertised a 12 month warranty.  They responded within 24 hours and were very helpful in first helping me trouble shoot the issue, then ultimately sending me a brand new keyboard when the trouble shooting failed.  They did ask I send a video of the problems I was experiencing so they could provide feedback to the engineers on how to prevent/address such issues in the future.  The new until works flawlessly.  Exceptional customer service !!",Excellent product with exceptional customer service!,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2023",TRUE,5
B0CN312XV4,"I went through 4 different keyboards before finally settling on this one. I originally started off with the Logitech Trackpad but quickly returned it as I wasn’t able to set the iPad on my lap and use it in the car.From there I went with the actual Apple Magic Keyboard which in all honest I REALLY liked, BUT it didn’t have any of the “quick keys” to control the volume, brightness and switching between apps and locking the iPad (more on that in a second). Sure there were some keyboard shortcuts for some of the things but I really found myself missing the versatility of the quick keys and being able to spin the iPad around and just use it as a tablet.My last ditch effort before settling for this keyboard was the ZAGG Folio Trackpad. My biggest complaint with it was mainly that I couldn’t just quickly pickup the iPad and keyboard and move it from one location to another without having to collapse it down.I’m only giving this 4 stars as not ALL of the extra function keys are presently working with my main complaint being the single click of the lock and it auto locking the iPad. Outside of that this is a FANTASTIC keyboard with all of the features and functionality that I’m looking for.If someone knows how to get the lock key to function as well as the Globe to open up the default browser I would gladly move this up to a 5 start review as outside of those two small issues this is a great keyboard for the money!",Best Value for the Money,"Reviewed in the United States on December 24, 2023",TRUE,4

B0CN312XV4,"UPDATED Aug. 7, 2023.  I did eventually see a message to contact BABG in regards to this issue.  They promptly sent me a new keyboard case.  Like the first one it is functioning and wonderful!  Their customer service was great.  They asked only that I send them a video but I can’t find the case so I suspect in my disappointment I tossed it.  I just wanted to post this because their customer service was great.UPDATED May 8, 2023: I have been using this case and still say I love the concept HOWEVER,  after using it for awhile the small pieces at the bottom that hold the iPad in place no longer do so.  With use it does begin to turn easier to flip and use for writing… but, eh the iPad starts to pop out then too so you still have to go slow.  I would not buy this particular one again nor would I recommend it until they come up with a better idea to keep the iPad securely in place.I received this yesterday.  To connect to blue tooth you have to press the fn + C button.  I looked at the top for the fn key.  It is bottom left.  The case seems sturdy.  A little hard to turn the iPad case so you can view it from different angles or fold it ( you have to turn the top all the way around until iPad is facing away from  you then lay it down to use it as a tablet).  It feels sturdy,  the keyboard is great and you have options for backlight color but I honestly don’t care about the color.  I love that the pencil sits in the case instead of the table where my grand daughter found it.  The only issue I have is that the iPad and pencil always start to slide out when I try to open it.  It does disconnect from blue tooth.  IF you stop using it for a few minutes but if you click on a key it reconnects quickly.  I LOVE that I can get to the volume buttons from the keyboard again.  As I type this the cursor does sometimes move but I believe that’s because I hit the trackpad.  When not in use you can easily turn the trackpad off by pressing fn +t while you type and press it again to turn the trackpad back on.  I gave it a 4 start because the iPad falling out is so far the only issue I have with it and one I’m sure I will become accustomed to.",Love it but…..,"Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2023",TRUE,4
